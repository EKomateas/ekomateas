# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Efthymios Komateas — a software developer, systems architect, and technical consultant with over 30 years of experience in building custom applications, databases, and scalable web solutions.

My work spans from scheduling systems to AI-powered image platforms, with a strong focus on clarity, modularity, and real-world impact. I specialize in Python, PHP, C++, Visual Basic, SQL, and Linux server administration, and I’ve built tools for sports federations, luxury brands, startups, and family businesses.

Feel free to explore my repositories...

Thanks for stopping by!
